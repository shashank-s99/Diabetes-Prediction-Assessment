This project utilizes SQL to analyze a simulated healthcare dataset from Psyliq, focusing on uncovering potential predictors of diabetes. We delve into patient demographics, health indicators, and lifestyle habits to gain valuable insights and pave the way for developing effective diabetes prediction models.


## Key Objectives

- Data Exploration: Analyze patient demographics, health metrics, and lifestyle habits to understand the overall healthcare picture.

- Trend Identification: Uncover relationships between factors like age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and smoking history to identify potential predictors of diabetes.

- Data Manipulation: Master essential SQL skills for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and modification to facilitate efficient analysis.

- Schema Optimization: Evaluate the database schema for redundancy and integrity, proposing improvements for enhanced data quality and performance.
## Technical Stack

- Database Management System (DBMS): PostgreSQL
- SQL dialect: Standard SQL
## Methodology

1- Data Acquisition: Load the provided Psyliq healthcare dataset into PostgreSQL.

2- Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries to analyze data distribution, descriptive statistics, and visualizations.

3- Trend Identification: Craft SQL queries to identify correlations between various factors and their potential influence on diabetes risk.

4- Data Manipulation: Apply essential SQL skills like filtering, grouping, joining, and modifying data to facilitate deeper analysis and address missing values or outliers.

5- Schema Optimization: Analyze the database schema for inconsistencies, redundancies, and data integrity issues. Propose modifications to enhance data quality and performance optimization.
## Project Deliverables:

- SQL script file containing all queries used for data analysis, manipulation, and optimization.

- Project PDF document showcasing the executed queries and their corresponding outputs, along with interpretations and insights gained from the analysis.
## Target Audience:

- Data analysts and scientists interested in healthcare data analysis and predictive modeling using SQL.

- Database administrators seeking to improve data quality and performance within healthcare contexts.

- Individuals interested in learning and applying SQL for healthcare data exploration and manipulation.
## Future Work:

- Implement machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction based on the identified insights and patterns.

- Explore more complex healthcare datasets with additional factors like genetics and medication history.

- Develop interactive dashboards for visualizing and interacting with the healthcare data.


This project showcases the power of SQL in unlocking valuable healthcare insights and paves the way for further research and development of effective diabetes prediction tools. We welcome feedback and collaboration to continue refining our understanding and building robust solutions for diabetes risk assessment.
